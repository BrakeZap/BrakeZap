# Hi there!

I'm **Kyle Smith**, a 24-year-old freelance Java developer from California.  
Beyond programming, I have a passion for language theory and design.  

In my free time, you'll often find me:  
- Creating **Minecraft plugins/mods**  
- Exploring **new programming languages**  

Lately, my favorite has been [**V**](https://vlang.io/)
